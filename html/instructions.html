    <h3 class = "instruc-h">Blackjack Hi-Lo / High Low Card Counting System</h3>
    <p class = "white">The Hi-Lo card counting style is one of the most well known of them all. Other names for this style are also known as High-Low or Plus-Minus card counting. The Hi-Lo system was first invented by the mathematician Harvey Dubner and later improved by
      Professor Edward Throp, who was one of the founding fathers of card counting strategy. The Hi-Lo strategy is very easy to use by both novices and more advanced players. The high-low card counting method is the most commonly used type because of
      how easy it is to use and is most especially used by blackjack teams.</p>
    <h3 class = "instruc-h">Hi-Lo Card Counting Strategy Details</h3>
    <p class = "white">The first thing all blackjack players must do is learn and memorize the blackjack basic strategy and then complement this to the Hi-Lo method. You need to do this in order to maximize your edge as much as possible and this requires a nearly perfect
      game. The High-Low strategy starts by keeping track of every card that is seen on the table. This means watching what cards the dealer throws down and the cards that the other players have down as well. Each card is assigned a "count" value or point.
      A list of point values for each card is shown in the table below:</p>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <td>Card Value </td>
        <td>Points</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>2, 3, 4, 5, 6</td>
        <td>+1</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>7, 8, 9</td>
        <td>0</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>10, J, Q, K, A</td>
        <td>-1</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <h3 class = "instruc-h">High and Low Count Values - When to Bet</h3>
    <p class = "white">The high-low card counting system is a balanced system. This means that when you start your count off at 0, you should end your count at 0 as well when every card has been seen and the deck needs to be shuffled again. This is because the lower five
      cards have +1 values and the upper five cards have -1 values so they cancel each other out. The best way to master this system is to keep practicing outside of the casino. You can learn to increase your counting speed by having yourself or someone
      quickly deal a deck of cards and you try to keep up with the count. Because this is a balanced card counting system, you should end up with a count of 0 at the end. If the count is not zero, then you know you have miscounted!</p>
    <p class = "white">An example of an unbalanced system is the KO or knockout method of card counting where the ending total is not zero. Now for the Hi-Lo blackjack system, you are trying to wait for a high positive number before betting big. This means many small cards
      have been used up and your edge increases when more big cards are left in the game. Also, card counting also tells you when not to bet. When there is a large negative count, then there are a bunch of small cards left in the deck and it's best to
      conserve your bet and wait for this bad swing to pass.</p>
    <h3 class = "instruc-h">Hi Opt 1 / High Opt I Blackjack Card Counting System</h3>
    <p class = "white">This type of card counting system is known by a few names such as Hi Opt I or High Opt. Basically this is short for "Highly Optimum" and is a very advanced system of card counting. This is one reason why it is sometimes called the Einstein count method.
      It is not much different than the Hi-Lo system and it is another one of the balanced card counting systems. A balanced system means that when you start your count off at 0, you should be able to end your count at exactly 0 when all of the cards
      are used up.</p>
    <p class = "white">Because of this system's highly optimal characteristics, it should be providing you with some of the highest odds that you can achieve through card counting. It is pulling out and maximizing blackjack efficiency in the game. We recommend learning
      Hi-Lo counting first before understanding this method because of the steeper learning curve. The advantage is only slightly greater with the first Hi-Opt 1 card counting method and is best for advanced blackjack players. There are some people who
      would disagree and swear by this system of card counting. I guess it just depends on what the type of player is and other elements in the game.
    </p>

    <h3 class = "instruc-h">Hi-Opt I Card Counting Strategy Guide</h3>
    <p class = "white">The foundational aspect of all card counting strategies is to supplement them with the blackjack 21 basic strategy. The basic strategy is a list of what moves you should make to give you the the most optimum mathematical advantage. It tells you the
      "correct" move to make when given a combination of dealer and player hands. After you have this down, you will be playing the most efficient game and making all the perfect moves.</p>

    <p class = "white">The next step is to implement the Hi-Opt I system to make the house edge flip over to your edge. Each card is assigned a count value. So when a card appears on the table, you add or subtract to your total count depending on what the card is. Keep
      in mind that you need to keep track of everyone's cards, including the dealer and all the other players. It is best to wait for the deck to be shuffled and then start your count at 0. When the deck is all used up, the count should again be 0 at
      the end. A list of count values per card in the Hi-Opt 1 method is shown below:</p>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <td>Card Value </td>
        <td>Points</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>2</td>
        <td>0</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>2, 3, 4, 5, 6</td>
        <td>+1</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>7, 8, 9</td>
        <td>0</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>10, J, Q, K</td>
        <td>-1</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>A</td>
        <td>0</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p class = "white">The only difference between the highly optimal system and the high-low system is the two and ace cards have 0 points and you don't count these. You are still counting low cards and high cards but not the middle cards. Most important, when you are
      using the High Opt I method, you should NOT be writing down your count. Counting should all be done in your head. Some players don't realize this but you can be kicked out of a casino if they find out you are counting cards. People get confused
      because you are gladly welcome to bring in a basic strategy blackjack chart with all the correct moves. They let you do this because the casino still has the mathematical edge so they don't care.</p>
